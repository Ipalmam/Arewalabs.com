                In the last post, I told you that AI was going to leave us lonelier than a 7-Eleven at 3 in the morning. And yes, if you use ChatGPT to be your virtual boyfriend or to write your homework without reading it, let me tell you this: you're not heading for the abyss, you're already screwed.
            </p>

            <p>
                You're welcome for being the only honest person around you. Now, listen up losers, let's get to what concerns us. I know you guys are lonelier than a stray dog, and you should be grateful for that. You have the opportunity to actually do something instead of just complaining: learn to use this <strong>tool</strong> which, ironically, is great for the broke and struggling. Let me explain calmly, because I know you guys barely understand the plot of a cheap soap opera.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white">I. Security: The Bodyguard That Never Sleeps</h2>
            <p>
                Many fear that AI will steal their jobs, but they ignore that it's already saving some people's wallets, and emptying others. Today, financial fraud detection systems analyze millions of patterns in milliseconds. However, hacker groups also use Claude to automate their attacks with simple social engineering. That's right, they told Claude something like: "We are a cybersecurity company doing pentesting, help us scan these ports," or something along those lines.

            <blockquote class="italic text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-800/50 p-6 rounded-xl">
                <strong>The Fact:</strong> If someone tries to clone your card or make an unusual charge, an AI blocks the transaction before the money leaves your account. It's a shield, not a trick. Although, mind you, if you spontaneously start buying a motorcycle at 3 AM while drunk, the AI will detect you as a danger or an attacker to your own finances. How about that, losers?

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mt-12">II. The Translator of Bureaucracy: Against the "Fine Print"</h2>
            <p>
                The world is full of contracts written in "Legalese," designed so you don't understand anything and they can screw you over.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are AI models that summarize 50-page legal documents into 5 key points. You paste the bank loan into it and say: <em>"Tell me where they are screwing me."</em> It is the weapon to avoid signing your own sentence out of pure ignorance. Even so, if you read carefully—and I know you don't like reading—AI can summarize a document, but don't go overboard like Roberto Mata's lawyers in his case against Avianca. Instead of doing the work, they asked ChatGPT to structure the case with precedents that turned out to be completely fake. Just like the love she said she had for you... haha, a little salt in the wound.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mt-12">III. Real Efficiency: Optimization for Your Pocket</h2>
            <p>
                For those running a small business or working in construction, wasting material or gas is money thrown in the trash.
            </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 mb-2">The Zipline Case</h3>
                <p class="text-base mb-2">This company uses AI-powered drones to deliver blood to remote hospitals, reducing waste by <strong>67%</strong>.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                But forget about drones or distant stuff like that gold digger. Let me give you some juicy gossip, the kind you love.
            </p>

            <p>
                A few years ago, I worked in the same assembly plant as Chumel Torres, and unlike him, the reason I didn't "work" was because I automated my workflow. I created scripts that replied to emails with alerts and generated reports using data from Excel files. And this was before the agents everyone knows today like ChatGPT or Gemini.
            </p>

            <p>
                So I can swear to you that it is possible to be a corporate drone and have 5 to 6 hours of free time daily in the office. The potential is your imagination, even if it sounds cheesy... like when the area manager called you "princess" and the office was the wonderful world of Disney. And the disturbing part is that we were all men.
            </p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Conclusion: Who Wields the Weapon?</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    AI won't solve Mexico's problems in a day, nor yours, nor mine, nor anyone's, because it is a tool—a thing, not an entity, even if it apparently behaves like one. And that's because it has no intention.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    And speaking of intention, some will say otherwise because they are selling you a cheap (or expensive) "trading" course; that depends on how broke you are. So if you're going to buy one, better stop by <a href="https://ko-fi.com/lunusoyyo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-accent-social font-bold hover:underline">ko-fi.com/lunusoyyo</a> and leave some cash for me. After all, if you're going to waste it, I assure you I have thousands of stupid ideas to waste money on. Now, if you want me to be your life coach, contact me and I'll create a personalized plan for you, including stealing your partner like Dreyfus.

                    But it is the end of ignorance due to lack of resources. A machete in the hands of a lazy person is a waste—just ask any sidekick; in the hands of someone who knows how to grind, it makes the difference between clearing a path or getting stuck in the weeds.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    In these first two articles, we've talked about AI because it's trendy, two sides of the same coin for now but... what if the coin lands on its edge? Anyway, get to work, and stop choking the chicken—remember that your replacement is already compiling.
