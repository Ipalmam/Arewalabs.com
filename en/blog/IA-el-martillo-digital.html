                Most people treat AI like a magic lamp. They rub the prompt window and expect a genie to solve their life. Spoiler: It doesn't work that way.
            </p>
            <p>
                In <strong>Arewa Labs</strong>, we have a different definition. For us, Artificial Intelligence is not a replacement for thinking; it is a <strong>force multiplier</strong>. It’s a digital hammer. But here's the thing about hammers: they are only useful if you already know where the nail is.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white">I. The Tool of the "Nobodies"</h2>
            <p>
                Eduardo Galeano spoke about "the nobodies"—those who cost less than the bullet that kills them. In the digital age, AI is the first tool in history that levels the playing field for those without millions in capital.
            </p>
            <p>
                A single person with a well-configured local LLM (Large Language Model) now has the research power of a 1990s law firm and the creative speed of a 2000s design agency. AI is the great equalizer, but only for those who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty with code and logic.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-accent-social pl-4 italic text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-800/50 p-4 rounded-r-lg">
                "AI won't replace you. Someone using AI better than you will."
            </blockquote>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mt-12">II. Don't Cut Your Fingers Off</h2>
            <p>
                If you give a chainsaw to someone who doesn't know how to handle it, they won't build a house; they'll end up in the ER. The same applies here. Using AI without understanding <strong>Prompt Engineering</strong> or <strong>Context Management</strong> is just a faster way to make mistakes.
            </p>
            <p>
                We see it every day: companies automating their customer service with LLMs that hallucinate and give away discounts or insult users. They forgot that the tool needs a craftsman.
            </p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">The Arewa Approach</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Our philosophy is simple: <strong>Human in the Loop</strong>. We use AI to automate the robotic part of our work, so we can focus on the human part: strategy, ethics, and narrative.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Whether we are developing <strong>Keyah</strong> or coding <strong>Escuadron 201</strong>, AI is the hammer that builds the structure, but the blueprint—the soul—comes from us.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    So, stop asking the AI to "do your job." Start asking it to help you do a job you couldn't even imagine yesterday.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    In these first two articles, we have talked about AI simply because it is trendic topic. We have seen two sides of the same coin so far, but... <strong>what if the coin lands on its edge?</strong>
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    Anyway, quit <strong>jerking around</strong> and I mean literally remember that your replacement is already compiling.
