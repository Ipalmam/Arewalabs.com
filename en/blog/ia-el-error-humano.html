                In past articles, we said AI is a hammer. Well, turns out some people are using it to brush their teeth. And when they smash their mouth, they blame the hammer.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today we are going to talk about what we in cybersecurity call the <strong>"Layer 8 Error"</strong>: the problem located between the chair and the keyboard. That means you. Because AI has no "evil intentions," but your lack of judgment definitely has consequences.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white">I. The Public Confessional</h2>
            <p>
                Let's be real. If ChatGPT is owned by a US corporation (or Chinese, or whatever), why on earth are you pasting your company's source code or your clients' financial data into it for a summary?
            </p>
            <p>
                There were engineers at Samsung who uploaded confidential code to "optimize it" and basically gifted it to the training model. <strong>Golden Rule:</strong> If the AI is free, the product is you (and your data).
            </p>
            <blockquote class="italic text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-800/50 p-6 rounded-xl">
                <strong>The Reality:</strong> Using a public AI to process private data is like shouting your password in the middle of the town square. It's not "intelligence," it's negligence.
            </blockquote>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mt-12">II. The Collective Hallucination</h2>
            <p>
                People say: <em>"The AI is hallucinating."</em> No, buddy. AI is a probabilistic model; it predicts the next word that sounds good, not the one that is true.
            </p>
            <p>
                The one hallucinating is you, believing a chatbot is an encyclopedia validated by a notary. If you ask for a legal reference and it invents a law that doesn't exist (it already happened to real lawyers in the US), the fault isn't on the beta software, it's on the "professional" who didn't verify the source.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mt-12">III. The Copy-Paste Zombie</h2>
            <p>
                We are creating a generation of programmers and creators who know how to paste, but don't know how to read.
            </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-red-600 dark:text-red-400 mb-2">The Real Danger</h3>
                <p class="text-base mb-2">
                    If you copy code from an AI for your banking app and that code has a basic vulnerability you can't detect because "you were too lazy to learn," you are not a developer, you are a public hazard.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Conclusion: Don't Be a "Prompt-Monkey"</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    AI is amazing for removing the boring part of the job, but it must never replace your final judgment. Use it to draft, but you edit. Use it to code, but you audit.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    At Arewa Labs we use AI, sure, but under controlled, local environments when it comes to serious stuff (like in <strong>Keyah</strong>). We don't give away our intellectual property just to save 5 minutes.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    So next time the AI "makes a mistake," ask yourself: Who was behind the wheel?
                </p>
